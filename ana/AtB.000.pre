The French Revolution was an expression of seeking FREEDOM from DESPOTISM, which had been established for centuries in France, and was passed on through a labyrinth of offices. The revolt was not against Louis XVI, but against the hereditary despotism of the established government, rather than the person or principles of the king. Louis XVI's moderation was not enough to alter this hereditary despotism, and a complete revolution was required to cleanse the corruption and bring liberty to the people.

2. Burke's pamphlet on the French Revolution was filled with abusive rhetoric, despite France and its National Assembly having no involvement in English affairs. 

3. Burke disputes the right of the people of England to unilaterally choose their own rulers, cashier them for misconduct, and frame their own government.

The French Revolution was an expression of seeking FREEDOM from DESPOTISM, which had been established for centuries in France, and was passed on through a labyrinth of offices. The revolt was not against Louis XVI, but against the hereditary despotism of the established government, rather than the person or principles of the king. Louis XVI's moderation was not enough to alter this hereditary despotism, and a complete revolution was required to cleanse the corruption and bring liberty to the people.The French Revolution sought freedom from a hereditary despotism established over centuries, and evidence suggests it was provoked neither by the National Assembly nor Louis XVI. The National Assembly, despite being surrounded by foreign troops and undefended, persevered with action and courage to bring equality, hope, and a chance of freedom to France. The Bastille, a symbol of despotism, was a target of the Revolution, and its fall marked the start of liberty and new principles in France. The tragedy and violence of the Revolution is contrasted to the substantial accomplishments, showing that the sacrifices made were for the greater purpose of establishing democratic values.The French Revolution sought freedom from oppressive government established for centuries and had no provocation from either the National Assembly or Louis XVI. Citizens within the city took up arms and marched to the Bastille, a symbol of despotism, and its fall began the liberation of France. In the struggle, more of the citizens fell than their opponents, with others being executed for betrayal. The punishments seen during the Revolution were taken from those implemented by oppressive governments, aimed to destroy tenderness or incite revenge, and should be the impetus for governments to change their treatment of citizens. Mr. Burke's focus on outrages and violence over the successes of the Revolution is used to misrepresent the motives and events that led up to it.The French Revolution was a response to centuries of oppressive and despotic government. Despite having no involvement with England's affairs, Mr. Burke's pamphlet was filled with inflammatory rhetoric and misrepresentations of the Revolution and its motives. The expedition to Versailles was a demand of satisfaction from the Garde du Corps for their insults, with aims of peace and protection from both the Revolution's supporters and opposers. Ultimately, the Declaration of the Rights of Man and other Constitution decrees were signed, order was restored, and the King and Queen were taken to Paris amidst an enthusiastic welcome.

The French Revolution was an expression of seeking FREEDOM from DESPOTISM, which had been established for centuries in France, and was passed on through a labyrinth of offices. The revolt was not against Louis XVI, but against the hereditary despotism of the established government, rather than the person or principles of the king. Louis XVI's moderation was not enough to alter this hereditary despotism, and a complete revolution was required to cleanse the corruption and bring liberty to the people.The French Revolution sought freedom from a hereditary despotism established over centuries, and evidence suggests it was provoked neither by the National Assembly nor Louis XVI.

<sep>1. Nations should not provoke each other unprovoked. 

2. Burke's pamphlet on the French Revolution was filled with abusive rhetoric, despite France and its National Assembly having no involvement in English affairs.

The French Revolution was an expression of seeking FREEDOM from DESPOTISM, which had been established for centuries in France, and was passed on through a labyrinth of offices. The revolt was not against Louis XVI, but against the hereditary despotism of the established government, rather than the person or principles of the king. Louis XVI's moderation was not enough to alter this hereditary despotism, and a complete revolution was required to cleanse the corruption and bring liberty to the people.The French Revolution sought freedom from a hereditary despotism established over centuries, and evidence suggests it was provoked neither by the National Assembly nor Louis XVI. The National Assembly, despite being surrounded by foreign troops and undefended, persevered with action and courage to bring equality, hope, and a chance of freedom to France. The Bastille, a symbol of despotism, was a target of the Revolution, and its fall marked the start of liberty and new principles in France. The tragedy and violence of the Revolution is contrasted to the substantial accomplishments, showing that the sacrifices made were for the greater purpose of establishing democratic values.The French Revolution sought freedom from oppressive government established for centuries and had no provocation from either the National Assembly or Louis XVI. Citizens within the city took up arms and marched to the Bastille, a symbol of despotism, and its fall began the liberation of France. In the struggle, more of the citizens fell than their opponents, with others being executed for betrayal. The punishments seen during the Revolution were taken from those implemented by oppressive governments, aimed to destroy tenderness or incite revenge, and should be the impetus for governments to change their treatment of citizens.

Despite having no involvement with England's affairs, Mr. Burke's pamphlet was filled with inflammatory rhetoric and misrepresentations of the Revolution and its motives. The expedition to Versailles was a demand of satisfaction from the Garde du Corps for their insults, with aims of peace and protection from both the Revolution's supporters and opposers. Ultimately, the Declaration of the Rights of Man and other Constitution decrees were signed, order was restored, and the King and Queen were taken to Paris amidst an enthusiastic welcome.

Every citizen has a right to an account of their agents' conduct and a security of rights through a Constitution. Property is inviolable and sacred, only to be deprived in cases of evident public necessity with a just indemnity.

<sep>1. Nations should not provoke each other unprovoked. 

2. Burke's pamphlet on the French Revolution was filled with abusive rhetoric, despite France and its National Assembly having no involvement in English affairs. 

3. Burke disputes the right of the people of England to unilaterally choose their own rulers, cashier them for misconduct, and frame their own government.

4. The right of any generation to govern its own affairs cannot be disposed of by the assumptions of previous generations, as the living cannot be bound or controlled by the dead. 

5. Laws continue in force due to the consent of the living and not due to the assumption of the dead.The RIGHT of any generation to govern their own affairs cannot be disposed of by the assumptions of previous generations, as the living cannot be bound or controlled by the dead. Laws are in force due to the CONSENT of the living and not the assumption of the dead. The French Revolution was an expression of seeking FREEDOM from DESPOTISM, which had been established for centuries in France, and was passed on through a labyrinth of offices. The revolt was not against Louis XVI, but against the hereditary despotism of the established government, rather than the person or principles of the king. Louis XVI's moderation was not enough to alter this hereditary despotism, and a complete revolution was required to cleanse the corruption and bring liberty to the people.The French Revolution sought freedom from a hereditary despotism established over centuries, and evidence suggests it was provoked neither by the National Assembly nor Louis XVI. The National Assembly, despite being surrounded by foreign troops and undefended, persevered with action and courage to bring equality, hope, and a chance of freedom to France. The Bastille, a symbol of despotism, was a target of the Revolution, and its fall marked the start of liberty and new principles in France. The tragedy and violence of the Revolution is contrasted to the substantial accomplishments, showing that the sacrifices made were for the greater purpose of establishing democratic values.The French Revolution sought freedom from oppressive government established for centuries and had no provocation from either the National Assembly or Louis XVI. Citizens within the city took up arms and marched to the Bastille, a symbol of despotism, and its fall began the liberation of France. In the struggle, more of the citizens fell than their opponents, with others being executed for betrayal. The punishments seen during the Revolution were taken from those implemented by oppressive governments, aimed to destroy tenderness or incite revenge, and should be the impetus for governments to change their treatment of citizens. Mr. Burke's focus on outrages and violence over the successes of the Revolution is used to misrepresent the motives and events that led up to it.The French Revolution was a response to centuries of oppressive and despotic government. Despite having no involvement with England's affairs, Mr. Burke's pamphlet was filled with inflammatory rhetoric and misrepresentations of the Revolution and its motives. The expedition to Versailles was a demand of satisfaction from the Garde du Corps for their insults, with aims of peace and protection from both the Revolution's supporters and opposers. Ultimately, the Declaration of the Rights of Man and other Constitution decrees were signed, order was restored, and the King and Queen were taken to Paris amidst an enthusiastic welcome. Mr. Burke's exaggerated account of these events is an example of how distortions can be used to mischaracterize an entire revolution.The French Revolution was a response to centuries of oppressive and despotic government, with no provocation from the National Assembly or Louis XVI. Citizens took up arms and marched to the Bastille as a symbol of despotism, and its fall marked the start of liberty and new principles in France. The Declaration of the Rights of Man and other Constitution decrees were signed to establish democratic values and restore order. The collective rights of man derive from his natural rights, which are based on the unity of man established by his Maker and include religious freedom and intellectual rights. Civil rights are those which pertain to a member of society and are built upon natural rights, such as the right to security and protection. All generations of men possess the same right to govern their own affairs, which cannot be disposed of by the assumption of previous generations.The French Revolution was an expression of freedom from oppressive government, provoked neither by the National Assembly nor Louis XVI. Laws are in force due to the consent of the living, as the dead cannot bind or control them. Natural individual rights become civil rights when citizens collectively form a government. Governments must originate from the people and not be imposed by force or fraud, or else they possess no legal right to exist. The Constitution of a country should define the organization of the government, the powers it holds, and the rights of its citizens. Mr. Burke clearly misunderstands what a Constitution is, as demonstrated by his comparison between the English and French Constitutions.The French Revolution was a response to centuries of oppressive and despotic government, with no provocation from the National Assembly or Louis XVI. Laws are in force due to the consent of the living, as the dead cannot bind or control them. Natural individual rights become civil rights when citizens collectively form a government, with the Constitution of a nation defining the organization of government, its powers, and the rights of citizens. The Declaration of the Rights of Man and other Constitution decrees were signed to establish democratic values, restore order, and provide freedom from oppressive government. Mr. Burke's inflammatory rhetoric and misrepresentations of the Revolution aim to mischaracterize it and its motives. Much can be learned from the example of the French Constitution, as it abolished game laws, monopolies, persecution of citizens due to income, and granted the right of war and peace to the nation.The French Constitution seeks to free its citizens from centuries of oppressive and despotic government. It eliminates titles and their accompanying privileges, exalts the people into "Mans", and removes the power of declaring war from kings and ministers, instead placing it in the nation. Rights of man, both natural and civil, derive from divine unity, and should be protected from the control of the dead.

Mixed governments rely on corruption to operate, while a well-constructed republic is based on reason and provides for the security of the individual and the nation.
